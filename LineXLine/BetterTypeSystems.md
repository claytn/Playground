## A World of Better Type Systems


If there is one thing I hate about software development communities, it's the insistence on arguing about technology preferences. Text editor, framework, spaces vs tabs, etc. The answer to all of these is simple: it's a preference. A similar claim can be made about the argument between type systems. Dynamic or static? Which is best? What's easier to learn? What costs more developer time? 
I think most would agree that there is no definitive answer to this. Ultimately, you're making tradeoffs. This post isn't about heating up the type systems debate. Instead we're going to do a dive into today's static type systems. Are our type systems that helpful? And if not, could they be?
