Hi I'm Clayton!

I'm a recent graudate from Purdue University and just started my first
full-time job as a software engineer at Salesforce.com, and even more recently have 
joined the LineXLine team :) 

I've found that writing is a great way for me to stay involved in the devleopment community, and 
it forces me to learn new things outside of work. So, with those things in mind I was happy when Ben
offered up the idea to join the team!

Being an intro post I should give a bit more background on myself.
As mentioned I just started a job at Salesforce. I've joined a team in the company that
was acquired in 2016 called Krux Digital. We work on a variety of web and browser tracking 
tools. Outside the office I enjoy skateboarding, programming, and sinking uncountable hours
into youtube.

Everyone on the LineXLine team is writing about something a little differnt in the world of
tech. My posts will be very developer focused. Some things I plan to talk about are programming language design,
rebuilding popular libraries/frameworks, interesting programming problems, and whatever else I find that interests
me! In short, I like digging into how things work under the hood and finding the best ways to write software.
